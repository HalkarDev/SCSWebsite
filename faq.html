            <p>FAQ:</p>
            <p>
            Q: Who are you, developer?<br />
            A: A really weird dude making really bad games.<br />
            Q: What is this game about?<br />
            A: It is a game taking place over the course of three in-game weeks, the goal simply being to survive as Skylar Cash.<br />
            Q: How long will it take to develop the full game?<br />
            A: Impossible to say. Hopefully not too long though; I'm already making decent progress.<br />
            Q: What engine is this game made in?<br />
            A: Unity.<br />
            Q: What coding language is this game made in?<br />
            A: The primary language in Unity, C#. <br />
            Q: What knowledge do you have as far as coding?<br />
            A: My strongest language is C#. However, I have limited knowledge in C, C++, and Python as well. And, considering I made this website, I also know HTML, CSS, and Javascript quite well.<br />
            Q: What got you into game development?<br />
            A: The guy who inspired me is a pedophile, so I don't feel a need to say his name. The short answer,<br />
            which is leaving out some details, is that making my own worlds and getting recognition for it seemed cool.<br>
            Q: Is this game appropriate for children?<br>
            A: Not exactly. I would list it as Teen due to its inclusion of strong language and some blood and mild violence.
            Q: What's to be expected to come in the future?<br>
            A: As far as this website concerns, probably more FAQ entries as I get more of them, as well as more images in the gallery.
